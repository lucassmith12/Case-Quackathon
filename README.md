<h1> Welcome to the Case Quackathon!</h1>
We have an exciting day of work today, and we have a couple of things for you to complete before you get started.

First, make sure you have python installed, and that it is python3. You can verify this by running the "python3" command in your terminal or command prompt.

Next, install pip if you dont have it already. You can find instructions to download it <a href =https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>here</a>.

Lastly, you need to install the Qiskit SDK with pip. Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:
<code>
  pip install -U qiskit
  pip install qiskit_aer
  pip install qiskit_optimization
  pip install qiskit_finance
  pip install qiskit
  pip install pylatexenc
</code>

After that, you should be all set! Good luck and happy coding!
