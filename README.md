<h1> Welcome to the Case Quackathon!</h1>
We have an exciting day of work today, and we have a couple of things for you to complete before you get started.

First, make sure you have python installed, and that it is python3. You can verify this by running the <code>python3 --version</code> command in your terminal or command prompt.

Next, install pip if you don't have it already. You can find instructions to download it <a href =https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/>here</a>.

Lastly, you need to install the Qiskit SDK with pip. Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:
<code>
  pip install -U qiskit
  pip install qiskit_aer
  pip install qiskit_optimization
  pip install qiskit_finance
  pip install qiskit
  pip install pylatexenc
</code>

After that, you should be all set! Good luck and happy coding!
